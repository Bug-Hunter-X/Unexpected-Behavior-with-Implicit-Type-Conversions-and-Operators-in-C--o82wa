# Unexpected Behavior with Implicit Type Conversions and Operators in C#

This example demonstrates how implicit type conversion in C#, when combined with operators such as addition (+) or increment (++), can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered. The implicit conversion operators in the MyClass class allow seamless conversion between MyClass objects and integer values.

However, this flexibility can be problematic when using operators that aren't explicitly defined for the custom class.  The addition operation in the provided example does not have a defined behavior; it leverages the implicit conversion to int, performs the integer addition, and then implicitly converts back to a MyClass object. This behavior is not always apparent and can result in unexpected results if one is not careful.

The solution shows how to define the addition operator explicitly to control its behavior.  This is generally better than relying on implicit conversions, as this removes ambiguities and increases code readability.  Consider the potential implications of operator overloading when dealing with user-defined implicit conversions.
